  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    This is the first proper build of AFPD, and was also released on itch.io.
    Much of the instability present in Neo Fight Fighters has been cleaned up at this point, though the level of polish would only continue to grow in subsequent builds.
    To promote its release beforehand, I created a trailer, introducing the three playable characters and teasing the next character I was working on, Prince Slime.
    The second trailer was released around the same time as the build was released on itch.io, I created a second trailer, showcasing Prince Slime.
    This trailer would feature the first music track created by a friend of mine, wishing to only be credited as "FUG," who would go on to create several more tracks for the game.
    This build would also add voice acting to the game, courtesy of a friend of mine, Cole Stanley, voicing the announcer.
    Thus this update marked the first where I was not the sole contributor to this project.
    This version of the game adds special attacks, but lacks many mechanics that would be added in later builds, such as ground dashes.

    Sputnik, the sewer creature with big dreams, was introduced in an alpha build before this that was unfortunately lost to time. In that build he was a significantly stronger character as in this build I introduced SDI, a mechanic that helps players escape combos.
    Sputnik was the first cameo character in AFPD, originally appearing in one of my earlier games, <a href = "https://yadunded.itch.io/help-sputnik-get-to-space-"><em>Help Sputnik Get To Space</em></a>.
    To coincide with the release of Sputnik, I created a new stage, Space Highway, also from <em>Help Sputnik Get to Space</em>. The stage features an original medley remix of the music from HSGtS, and is an absolute banger.

    This build's second new character, Prince Slime, originates from an old sketch of mine that I happened to stumble across when inspiration struck. His trident in particular I found could be mechanically interesting, using it to stake his opponents and throw them in different directions.
    Even now, Prince Slime sports the highest sprite count of any other character, at over 110 unique frames of animation, though Sputnik comes close at 99 frames, and TC-C016, which would be released in 0.4.0 at 98 frames.
    Artistically and technically, Prince Slime presented several challenges that ended up changing many things going forward.
    From an aesthetic design perspective, fitting Prince Slime's relatively complicated design into AFPD's crayon-drawn art style was a major hurdle that shifted certain aspects of the art style.
    Going forward, character outlines would need to be finer, and fully opaque, to properly convey the characters' finer details. This was a positive change that I believe improved the art in general, and I was already leaning toward this direction with Sputnik's sprites, but it made Cat Tosser and Carpenter Chicken's art look a little more dated.
    The technical issues cropped up when I realized that Prince Slime's art would have to be much larger than the previous characters to enable his higher melee range.
    Since it would be wasteful to make all of his sprites that size, I had to come up with a solution to allow for characters to have variable sprite sizes.
    In addition, the sprite packer software I had been using couldn't handle Prince Slime's sprite count, so I had to bounce around alternatives before finding one that worked while requiring minimal changes to the game itself.
    Ultimately these design issues served as stress tests that only improved the game's technical foundation and workflow, and I'm glad I ran into them when I did.
