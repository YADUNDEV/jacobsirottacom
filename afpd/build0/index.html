<h1>First Prototype: Cat Tossers Showdown</h1>
<div id="game" style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: center"></div>
<h2>About</h2>
<div class = "about">>
  <p>
  At this early stage I was aching to create a platform fighter, but I wasn't sure how viable it would be within the Phaser 3 API.
  Cat Tossers Showdown proved to be a great way to test the waters and get a feel for Phaser's capabilities, but is also a unique game in its own right.
  The mechanics are heavily simplified relative to what you would find in a traditional platform fighter.
  There are no attacks, no hitstun, no stocks, no health or knockback scaling. Your only means of offense is to grab cats that constantly fall from the sky, and chuck them at your opponent.
  Your only means of defense is a directional air-dodge, which can also still be used to wavedash.
  Once you are struck by a cat, you are left completely vulnerable until you land on the ground.
  The result is a very fast-paced party game for two players.

    The game plays a little differently from AFPD, so details on how to play are listed below.

    <li><h2>Mechanics:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Throwing: You can throw cats up, down, left, or right. This can be done in a variety of ways.
          <ul>
            <li>Default Toss: Pressing the throw button while not touching the analog stick/movement keys will throw the cat forward at a normal speed.</li>
            <li>Soft Toss: Only possible on gamepad, by slightly tilting the analog stick in the direction you would like to throw.</li>
            <li>Normal Toss: Done by tilting the analog stick at a medium range or by tilting the stick at full range for a certain amount of time will result in a normal toss.</li>
            <li>Hard Toss: Done by suddenly flicking the analog stick at full range when throwing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Double Jumping: While in the air, you may jump one additional time.</li>
        <li>Air Dash: While in the air, you may gain a sudden boost of speed in any desired direction. While in this state, if you are not already holding a cat, you will pick one up if you dash over it.</li>
        <li>Wavedashing: Jumping and immediately dashing down-left or down-right will maintain your x momentum after landing on the ground.</li>
        <li>Shorthopping: Releasing the jump button before your jumpsquat animation ends will allow you to decrease the vertical gain of your jump.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
