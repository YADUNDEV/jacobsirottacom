<h2>About</h2>
<div class="about">
  <p>
    0.4.0 was light on new features, but it did add pause functionality, among a few minor things such as a framerate monitor.
    Its most notable addition is a new character, TC-C016, the second cameo appearance, originally appearing as the protagonist in one of my very first projects that was unfortunately never completed, a survival horror sidescroller called <a ref="https://youtu.be/MFtREJp5sSI"><em>SAFE</em></a>.
    For more information on how this character was designed, click <a href='../concept'>here</a>.

<h2>Original Patch Notes</h2>
<div class="patch_notes">
  <p>Version 0.4.0 is now live!</p>
  <p>And with it comes a new character: TC-C016, the protagonist from my cancelled survival horror title, <em>SAFE</em>.</p>
  <p>
    TC's primary gimmick is their rocket boot double jump, which allows them to fly about until they run out of fuel. Continue your flight by holding the jump button, or change directions by double-jumping again, at the cost of using more fuel.
    Performing an air attack while double jumping will allow you to perform a double-jump cancel (DJC), which is useful for combos and movement.
  </p>
  <p>
    TC's special attack is Reflector, which, as the name suggests, reflects projectiles and items that collide with it back at the attacker. It puts out hitboxes as well, and is useful for combos and movement.
  </p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Aside from the new character, here are the noteworthy changes:</p>
  <p>New Features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can now pause during gameplay! While paused you can also move the camera around and zoom in/out, as well as exit the match.</li>
    <li>You can now view the game's framerate during play, visit game settings to enable.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Balance Changes:&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cat Tosser gains slightly more vertical speed from their special attack.</li>
    <li>Decreased Carpenter Chicken's GAF damage from 11 to 5, increased its knockback-growth from 40 to 50.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notable Gameplay Changes:&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bridge of Tossing and Space&nbsp; Highway blast zones adjusted.</li>
    <li>You now bounce off of walls when hit with a strong enough attack.</li>
    <li>Input is now retrieved on a per-key priority basis; Meaning that if you press jump 1 frame, and then press another button mapped to jump the very next frame, it will now read as 'pressed' rather than 'held'. This is primarily to make DJCs easier with TC-C016.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notable Visual/Audio Effect Additions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added new announcer voice lines.</li>
    <li>Added fire and electricity particle effects for appropriate moves.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Notable Bug Fixes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prince Slime will no longer be able to carry you around if something interrupts his throw animation.</li>
    <li>You can no longer cancel a grounded platdrop by releasing the analog stick.</li>
    <li>You can no longer get stuck in the stage (Greatly improved collision stability).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Known Issues:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TC-C016 does not render correctly in team battle modes (does not match team color).</li>
    <li>Sometimes pausing does not correctly pause velocity, resulting in characters drifting.</li>
  </ul>
