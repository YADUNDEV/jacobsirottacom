  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    0.3.1 is where I consider the game to have reached the level of polish of a full game.
    The game could now be played with up to 4 players, players can now configure their gamepad controls however they like allowing support for more input devices.
    A main menu was added, ui was improved, and bugs were squashed.

        <li>Decreased Sputnik's floatiness factor (weight) from 1.3 to 1.15. This will make him slightly harder to KO.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Prince Slime
      <ul>
        <li>Decreased damage on Prince Slime's grabs from 5 to 3 (The grab portion, not the throw).</li>
