  "description":"A survival-horror platformer prototype with an emphasis on narrative and horror design. An ambitious side-scrolling survival horror game with a unique design philosophy and deep story. Being one of my first attempts at game development, sobering lessons regarding organization and preproduction were learned. Development started some time around 2013-2014 and ended some time around 2014-2015.",
