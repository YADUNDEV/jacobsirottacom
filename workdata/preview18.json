  "description":"Cards & Clubs: The Game is a competitive 1-on-1 golf party game wherein the goal is to reach the hole before the other player by any means necessary. At each players' disposal is a deck of cards. These cards come in 3 types: Buffs, which tweak your swing or ball's physics to give you the upper-hand, Debuffs, which stunt the effectiveness of your opponents swing, and Obstacles, which summon physical objects that can be placed anywhere on the map. The game features a plethora of customization options including custom decks, custom controls, wearable hats, custom ball trails, and more. Cards & Clubs was developed alongside 5 other students as our senior capstone at GMU.",
